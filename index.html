          <h2 class="main__title">Is Bitcoin Sound Money?</h2>
          <p class="main__description">
            Throughout history we have used many forms of money to act as a
            medium of exchange between people. We transitioned to money, from
            the barter system, which became increasingly untenable as
            civilisation expanded.
            <br />
            <br />
            Humans used precious metals like Gold and Silver for thousands of
            years, however, a few decades ago we transitioned to fiat which
            isn't backed by anything. This has led to unconstrained inflation,
            reducing the purchasing power that money has.
          </p>
          <img class="main__img" alt="" />
          <p class="main__description main__description--second">
            There are three main properties that make good money. It has to be a
            good store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a store of value, Bitcoin seems to fare quite well, considering
            how much the value has increased since its inception. It's also
            incredibly value dense, considering it can absorb an indefinite
            amount of value.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a medium of exchange, it works very well. All you need is a
            private key to access your funds, without the permission from
            anyone. Bitcoin is also divisible into tens of millions of pieces.
            And for all practical purposes, it is fungible.
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, as a unit of account, it seems to be far better than the
            currencies that we use today. This is due to the predictable and
            fixed supply. It isn't inflated in an unconstrained manner, as is
            the case with fiat currencies.
